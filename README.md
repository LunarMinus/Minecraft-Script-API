# Minecraft-Script-API
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa \n
A Minecraft script api thing
(It uses nashorn and idk if you need to download the libraries)
What is it used for? Like liquidbounce's script api so you can make custom modules and bypasses.
If you can make it better plz do I made this in about 2 hours bcs I don't really know anyhting about nashorn or whatever
so yea just copy files
